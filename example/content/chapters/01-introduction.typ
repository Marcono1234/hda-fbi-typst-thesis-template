= Introduction

As part of their Bachelor's degree, students at the #gls("h-da") have to submit a thesis. A typesetting tool which can be used for this is Typst @bib:typst -- in case the supervising professor allows it.

Typst was developed by two students at the Technical University of Berlin in Germany. These students wrote their Master's theses on Typst and its implementation details. One of the theses focuses on the whole architecture of Typst @bib:typst-thesis-madje, whereas the other one explains in detail the advantages of using incremental compilation @bib:typst-thesis-haug.

In this thesis we show how Typst can be used to write a thesis for the Department of Computer Science at the #gls("h-da").
